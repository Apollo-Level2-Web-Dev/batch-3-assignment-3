# Car Washing System Backend

## Story
In a small town, there was a car wash run by an old man named Mr. Joe. People said his car wash had a special power – it made dreams come true.

One sunny day, a little girl named Lily visited the car wash with her dad. Lily had a big dream of becoming an artist, but she was shy and unsure if she was any good.

As Mr. Joe washed their car, he noticed Lily staring at the colorful soap bubbles. He smiled kindly and asked her about her dreams. Lily hesitated at first but then shared her passion for painting.

Mr. Joe listened intently, then handed Lily a brush and some paints. He told her to paint whatever she liked on the car windows. Lily's eyes lit up with excitement.

With shaky hands, Lily began to paint. She poured her heart onto the windows, creating a beautiful masterpiece. When she finished, she stepped back to admire her work, feeling proud.

From that day on, Lily's confidence grew. She painted everywhere she could, and her talent blossomed. Years later, Lily became a famous artist, known for her vibrant paintings.

And whenever she passed by the magic car wash, now run by Mr. Joe's grandchildren, she couldn't help but smile, remembering the day her dreams took flight.

You have been assigned the task of building the backend for a Car Washing System. The main focus of this assignment is to implement Error Handling, CRUD operations, Authentication & Authorization, Transaction & Rollback (If necessary)

## **Technology Stack:**

*   Use TypeScript as the programming language.
*   Use Express.js as the web framework.
*   Use Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) and validation library for MongoDB

## Main Part: (50 Marks)

### User Model

*   `name`: Full name of the user.
*   `email`: Email address used for communication and login.
*   `password`: Securely hashed password for authentication.

    *   `price`: Cost of the service in the local currency.
    *   `duration`**:** Duration of the service in minutes.
    *   `isDeleted`: Indicates whether the service is marked as deleted (false means it is not deleted).

### Slot Model

*   `service`: Reference to the specific service being booked.
*   `date`: Date of the booking.
*   `startTime`: Start time of the slot.

### **Hints for creating slots:**

  

1. **Retrieve Service Duration**: Assume the service duration is provided or retrieved from the database. For this example, we'll use a service duration of 60 minutes.
2. **Parse Request Body**: Extract the necessary information from the request body:
    *   Start time: "09:00"
    *   End time: "14:00"
    *   Service duration: 60 minutes
3. **Calculate the Total Duration**:
    *   Convert the start time and end time to minutes.
    *   Calculate the total duration between the start and end times in minutes.
4. **Generate Slot Time Intervals**:
    *   Determine the number of slots by dividing the total duration by the service duration.
    *   Generate start and end times for each slot.
5. **Example Calculation**
    1. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**:
    2. **Service Duration**: 60 minutes
    3. **Start Time and End Time**:
        *   Start Time: "09:00"
        *   End Time: "14:00"
    4. **Convert Times to Minutes**:
        *   "09:00" → 9 \* 60 = 540 minutes.
        *   "14:00" → 14 \* 60 = 840 minutes.
    5. **Calculate Total Duration**:
        *   Total Duration: 840 minutes - 540 minutes = 300 minutes
    6. **Number of Slots**:
        *   Number of Slots: 300 minutes / 60 minutes per slot = 5 slots
    7. **Generate Slot Time Intervals**:
        *   Slot 1: Start Time: "09:00", End Time: "10:00"
        *   Slot 2: Start Time: "10:00", End Time: "11:00"
        *   Slot 3: Start Time: "11:00", End Time: "12:00"
        *   Slot 4: Start Time: "12:00", End Time: "13:00"
        *   Slot 5: Start Time: "13:00", End Time: "14:00"

    ]
}
```

##   

## Bonus Part:

### **1\. No Data Found:**

When retrieving data, if the database collection is empty or no matching data is found, return the message: "No data found."

```elixir
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "No Data Found",
  "data":[]
}
```

### **2.Error Handling:**

Implement proper error handling throughout the application. Use global error handling `middleware` to catch and handle errors, providing appropriate error responses with error messages.

  

**Error Response Object Should include the following properties:**

*   success → false
*   message → Error Type → Validation Error, Cast Error, Duplicate Entry
*   errorMessages
*   stack

  

**Sample Error Response**

```swift
   {
    "success": false,
    "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection: univerity-management.students index: email_1 dup key: { email: \\"user2@gmail.com\\" }",
    "errorMessages": [
        {
            "path": "",
            "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection: univerity-management.students index: email_1 dup key: { email: \\"user2@gmail.com\\" }"
        }
    ],
    "stack": "MongoServerError: E11000 duplicate key error collection: univerity-management.students index: email_1 dup key: { email: \\"user2@gmail.com\\" }\\n    at H:\\\\next-level-development\\\\university-management-auth-service\\\\node_modules\\\\mongodb\\\\src\\\\operations\\\\insert.ts:85:25\\n    at H:\\\\next-level-development\\\\university-management-auth-service\\\\node_modules\\\\mongodb\\\\src\\\\cmap\\\\connection_pool.ts:574:11\\n    at H:\\\\next-level-development\\\\university-writeOrBuffer (node:internal/streams/writable:391:12)"
}
```

###   

### **3\. Not Found Route:**

Implement a global "Not Found" handler for unmatched routes. When a route is not found, respond with a generic message: "Not Found.”

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Not Found",
}
```
### **4\. Authentication Middleware:**

Implement an Authentication Middleware to authenticate your application. Ensures that only user  and admin can access their own accessible routes.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "You have no access to this route",
}
```

### **4\. Zod Validation:**
The API employs Zod for input validation, ensuring data consistency. When validation fails, a 400 Bad Request status code is returned, accompanied by detailed error messages specifying the erroneous fields and reasons.
